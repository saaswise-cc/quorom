"""Step 5 — the stakeholder list. The map: which specific people at the companies
that passed triage.

Serves all six columns of tab 4: Company, Name, Title, Recent contact?, LinkedIn,
Mobile in CRM?.

Ordering is two rules and no weighting: most senior first, recent contact
breaking ties between equals. Capped per company — the cap is a feature.

No action is suggested per person. Real outreach starts with a connection, may
become a message, and may or may not become a meeting request; a column
declaring one action per row is wrong at the first step and asserts a decision
that has not been made. The list says who is worth considering and stops.
