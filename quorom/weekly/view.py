"""Render the workbook as a single-page HTML view.

The workbook is the deliverable; this is the readable version of it — one page,
scannable, no tab-switching. It reads the .xlsx a run just wrote and renders it,
recomputing nothing. If a number here disagrees with the spreadsheet, this file
is the one that is wrong.

NOT for publishing. The page contains named contacts and email addresses from
your CRM. It is a local file to open, hand over, or attach — the rule about
contact data staying inside your own environment applies to it exactly as it
does to the workbook.

The page title comes from the account row, never from a literal. An
organisation's name in the code is the fork this repository bans, however
cosmetic.
