"""Storing a weekly run's three emitted files, when RETAIN_RUNS is on.

docs/setup.md §14. Nothing in the pipeline reads run_outputs back — this is
the write path only, and it runs only when the deployment has opted in
(quorom/config.py).

run_weekly's own `with db.connect(...)` block (quorom/weekly/run.py) closes
before the files are written, so this opens a connection of its own.
