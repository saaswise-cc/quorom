    **`ok` has three values, not two.** True and False are verdicts. None means
    the test did not run, because the firmographics it reads were never
    fetched — the CRM they come from is not configured.

    Without that third state, an unconfigured CRM returns empty strings here
    and every company fails on "no size": a judgement asserted about data
    nobody looked up. It is not cosmetic, because this test is also the filter
    feeding tab 4, so the same absence silently empties the stakeholder list —
    the mirror image of the MissingFocusProfile failure in `weekly/run.py`,
    where an absent profile makes the test pass everything instead.

    None is the idiom the rest of the pipeline already uses for "not checked":
    `in_salesforce`, `linkedin_in_crm` and tab 3's contact counts all use it,
    for exactly this reason.

    `country` is the HQ country on its own, not the joined display string. The
    test that preceded this one substring-matched a country list against
    "city, state, country", which is why the list held " us" with a leading
    space — to stop it matching inside "Australia".

    Two failures, kept apart: a country outside the selection is a decision the
    profile made, and no country at all is missing CRM data. They read the same
    before this, and a reader could not tell which they were looking at.
