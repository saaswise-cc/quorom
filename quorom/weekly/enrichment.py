"""The enrichment pass — a provider's second opinion, set beside the CRM's.

Runs only when an enrichment provider is configured (see `quorom/enrich/`), and
changes nothing when one is not. Serves:

  tab 1  Name, Title and LinkedIn (provider) — for people not in the CRM
  tab 2  Employees (provider), HQ (provider), Profile check
  tab 3  Still at company?, Title (provider), LinkedIn (provider), and which
         companies reach the map at all (a disputed verdict does)
  tab 4  the review queue

Three sources, and none is the truth. The CRM is what the customer has; the
provider is a second opinion that can be stale too; LinkedIn is what a person
checks, and the one that settles it. So a provider value is **never** written
over a CRM value — it is shown beside it, and a disagreement becomes a row in
the review queue for a person to settle.

Agreement is not correctness either. A provider may be one of the sources the
CRM was filled from, in which case the two agreeing says little. The queue
therefore holds disagreements and missing values; it does not certify the rest.
