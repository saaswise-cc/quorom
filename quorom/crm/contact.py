"""One person, as the pipeline reads them — whatever CRM they came from.

The field map makes a CRM's *custom* field names portable; this is the other
half, for the *standard* ones. An adapter hands back a `Contact`, so nothing
under `weekly/` knows what any CRM calls anything — which is what lets a second
CRM be added without touching a caller.

Six fields, each one read by a column:

  name           tab 3 'Name'
  title          tab 1 'Title (CRM)', tab 3 'Title', and the seniority ordering
  email          the key meeting history is joined on
  mobile         tab 1 and tab 3 'Mobile in CRM?' — presence only. The number
                 itself never leaves the CRM: sensitive contact fields pass
                 through to it and never into a Quorom store.
  linkedin       tab 1 'LinkedIn?' and tab 3 'LinkedIn'
  last_activity  one of the two sources behind tab 3 'Recent contact?'

`linkedin` is three-valued on purpose, and it is the reason this is not simply a
dict of strings:

  "https://…"  a URL on file
  ""           this CRM has the field; this person has nothing in it
  None         this CRM has no such field at all

Only the third means "not available in this CRM", and collapsing it into the
second is exactly the conflation the field map exists to avoid.
