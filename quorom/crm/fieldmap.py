"""The CRM field map — resolved from the org, never assumed.

Standard CRM fields are portable; custom fields are not, and custom fields are
where the signal lives. A hardcoded custom name is not a cosmetic wart: a field
that does not exist raises INVALID_FIELD and kills the whole query rather than
blanking a column, so it is a run that dies at the next customer. It is also
per-customer differentiation living in code, which forces the fork this
repository bans.

So the repository holds patterns, not names. At configure time this module
describes the object, matches its fields against those patterns, counts how many
rows actually have each candidate populated, and writes the survivors — in
count order — into the account's field map. Every query is then built from the
map.

**Ordered candidates, not a single winner.** The first populated value wins at
read time. On one real org the reason is concrete: three of the thirty-nine
companies met in a single week have an empty managed-package country field and
a populated `BillingCountry`. A map holding
only the better-populated field would blank their HQ and drop one of them out of
the ICP set. Ordering decides which field is asked first; the chain is what
stops a per-row gap becoming a wrong answer.

**Why counting is not enough on its own.** On the same org the best-populated
field matching /linkedin/ on Contact is the *company's* page, not the person's,
and it beats the field the pipeline wants. Patterns therefore carry exclusions
as well as inclusions, and
every rejection is recorded with the rule that made it, so the choice can be
argued with rather than taken on trust.

Unresolved optional fields degrade their column to "not available in this CRM".
Unresolved *required* fields — the ones a decision is made on — stop the
resolution rather than producing a run whose ICP test quietly passes everything.
