"""Salesforce — read-only, at read time, no sync.

Quorom holds no CRM data and no CRM tables. Contacts are fetched when a run
needs them and compared in context, which is what keeps the comparison current
and the schema small.

Field discipline: this module names **standard** fields only — the ones present
in every org. Every other field it reads comes from the account's resolved field
map (`fieldmap.py`), which is why there is not a single managed-package
or org-local API name below. A name invented by one customer's admin raises
INVALID_FIELD and kills the whole query rather than blanking a column, so a
hardcoded one is a run that dies at the next customer.

Every query here is therefore built in two halves: the standard fields, written
out, and `field_map.select(...)`, resolved. A client constructed without a map
still works and reads standard fields only — which is what a run with no
Salesforce configured, and every test, does.

What leaves this module is a `Contact`, never a Salesforce record. The standard
field names are as much a coupling as the custom ones — they are simply spelled
the same in every Salesforce org, which is not the same as being spelled the
same in every CRM.
