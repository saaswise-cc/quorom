"""HubSpot — marketing contacts, read-only, at read time.

Salesforce is the source of truth for accounts, contacts and titles. HubSpot
answers two narrower questions: is this attendee known to marketing at all, and
how large is the marketing pool at a domain.

Like the Salesforce adapter, what leaves here is a `Contact` — nothing under
`weekly/` should know that HubSpot spells a job title `jobtitle` and splits a
name across `firstname` and `lastname`.
