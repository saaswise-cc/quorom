"""Where a company's head office is, and whether that is somewhere you sell.

Two things live here: the region → country lists a focus profile selects from,
and the comparison the ICP test makes.

**Whole values, not substrings.** The test this replaces matched a country list
against a joined "city, state, country" display string, which is why that list
carried `" us"` with a leading space — without it, `"us"` matched inside
`"Australia"`, and every Australian company read as North American. Comparing
whole country values removes that class of bug rather than patching the next
instance of it: `"Austria"` is not `"Australia"` is not `"AU"`.

**Levels.** A selection is `{"level": ..., "value": ...}` at one of two levels,
`region` or `country`. A bare string is read as a region, because that is what
existing profiles hold. State and city levels are deliberately absent: matching
them needs name normalisation this does not do — `CA` is California or Canada
depending on the column, and Washington is a state and a city — and that is a
matching rule to design, not a list to extend.

**Unknown is refused, not ignored.** A profile naming a region this module does
not know used to apply no geography filter at all and say nothing, so every
company passed. Configuration is validated at `quorom init` and again before a
run starts. CRM *data* is never refused: a country an org holds that appears in
no region is simply outside the selection, which is an answer, not an error.
