"""`quorom init` — the two rows a fresh deployment cannot start without.

The migrations create empty tables. Two rows have to exist before the pipeline
does anything useful, and until now nothing created either of them:

  * the **account**, which every query in the product scopes on and which the
    importer reads `internal_domains` from to tell a colleague from a customer.
    Without it `quorom import` stops and says so.

  * the **active focus profile**, which carries the ICP test (employee band, HQ
    geography) and the seniority bar behind the stakeholder list. Without it the
    weekly run used to log a warning and carry on with every company met passing
    the ICP test — an artifact that looks entirely normal and is wrong. That is
    now a hard error in `quorom.weekly.run`; this module is how you satisfy it.

A third row is written where a CRM is reachable: the **resolved field map**
(`crm/fieldmap.py`), which is what lets every Salesforce query name
standard fields plus whatever this org actually calls the rest. It is resolved
by describing and counting rather than typed by anyone, and re-resolved by
`quorom resolve-fields` when the org's schema moves.

Everything written here is account configuration, not customer data. Nothing
customer-specific is in this file: the values come from the command line, the
account name from ACCOUNT_DOMAIN.
