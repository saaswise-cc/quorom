-- Quorom v1 — 0003_focus_profile: the per-account ICP configuration
--
-- The focus profile drives the whole product: it decides which companies are
-- ICP fits (employee band + HQ geography) and which titles clear the seniority
-- bar for the stakeholder list. It lives in your own database, read over the
-- same connection as the meeting data — so pointing the pipeline at a
-- different deployment is a connection-string change, not a code change.
--
-- This is per-account ICP configuration: which companies count, and which
-- titles are senior enough to list. It is not per-contact scoring — there is
-- no such feature here, and the profile is not a ranking input.
--
-- Read by FOCUS_PROFILE_SQL in quorom/db.py, and applied in
-- quorom/weekly/stakeholders.py.
--
-- The profile is scoped to the ACCOUNT, not to a user. A per-user profile
-- would need a `users` table and a hosted auth system to key off, and this
-- deploys single-tenant with neither; the pipeline already selects on
-- (account, is_active, max version) without reference to a user, so a user
-- column would be a foreign key to nothing, guarding a distinction the read
-- path never makes. In practice a deployment has exactly one active profile.

-- The pipeline reads the active profile for an account. One active row at a
-- time, enforced rather than assumed — two would make the run's ICP filter
-- depend on row order.
create unique index user_focus_profiles_one_active
  on user_focus_profiles (account_id)
  where is_active;

-- The 'user_' prefix is historical: the table is account-scoped, not per-user,
-- and nothing reads it per-user. The name is kept so that an existing data
-- load and the pipeline's query stay unchanged; renaming it is a cosmetic
-- change, better done once a load is finished than in the middle of one.
