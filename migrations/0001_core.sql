-- Quorom v1 — 0001_core: accounts, meetings, attendees
--
-- Designed backwards from what the pipeline reads. Every column below is either
-- read by a column of the stakeholder-map artifact or written by the Gong
-- importer that produces it; nothing is here speculatively. When a read path
-- later needs a column, a later migration adds it.
--
-- The write surface is quorom/gong/importer.py. The read surface is
-- WEEK_ATTENDEES_SQL and MET_HISTORY_SQL in quorom/db.py — the two queries the
-- weekly run makes against these tables.
--
-- The design decisions worth knowing about, each with its reason:
--
--   * No row-level security, and no dependency on a hosting platform's auth
--     schema. Quorom deploys single-tenant inside your own environment, with
--     account-scoped keys read from the environment rather than per-user
--     sessions — so row-level isolation has no user to key off, and policies
--     written against a managed platform's auth functions would not run on the
--     plain Postgres this is designed for.
--
--   * No credential columns. `accounts` holds no OAuth tokens, no enrichment
--     provider API key, no billing id, and no per-account Gong keys. The
--     README's rule is that secrets are read from the environment and never
--     committed — so Gong, Salesforce, HubSpot and provider credentials are env
--     config, not rows.
--
--   * `provider` and `domain_kind` are text + CHECK, not enums. Extending a
--     Postgres enum costs an `alter type ... add value` migration per value,
--     and comparing one in a query means casting `domain_kind::text` on every
--     read. A CHECK constraint extends with a plain ALTER and drops the cast.
--
--   * `accounts` keeps its id, and the account_id foreign keys stay, even though
--     a single-tenant deploy has exactly one row. Keeping the column is what
--     lets the same schema and the same queries ship to every deployment —
--     differentiation by config, never code.
