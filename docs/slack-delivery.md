# Slack delivery (worked example)

Section 14 of `setup.md` asks you to decide who receives each run — it
deliberately doesn't say how, because that's a real per-deployment choice. This
is one way to answer it: posting the `.xlsx` and `.html` to a Slack channel.

**Quorom has no delivery mechanism built in.** Everything below is code you add
in your own deployment, not something the tool does for you. That is the
boundary from §1: upstream is code you read and never edit; this is a worked
example of something you write on your side.

**Slack API behaviour described here was checked on 2026-09-11.**

## Webhook or bot token — decide this first

| Mode | Can attach files? | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| Incoming Webhook | No — text/blocks only | One URL, no app review |
| Bot token (`chat:write` + `files:write`) | Yes | A Slack app, installed to your workspace |

If you want the actual `.xlsx`/`.html` to land in the channel — not just a
message about them — you need a bot token. A webhook's API has no file-upload
capability at all; this isn't a permissions thing, it's a hard limit of that
API, and it's easy to build the webhook path halfway before hitting it.

## Setting up the bot token

1. Create a Slack app, scoped to `chat:write` and `files:write`, and install it
   to your workspace. This needs Slack workspace-admin access — if you don't
   have it, this is a request to whoever does, the same way the Salesforce
   External Client App in `salesforce-access.md` needs a Salesforce admin.
2. Invite the bot to the channel you want it posting to. Creating the app and
   installing it does not do this by itself — the bot has no channels until you
   add it to one, same as a human user would.
3. Get the channel's ID, not its name. `files_upload_v2` (below) takes the ID
   (e.g. `C0123ABCDEF`), not `#your-channel`.
4. Store the bot token (`xoxb-...`) in whatever secret store your deployment
   already uses for the Salesforce/Gong credentials — never in `.env` for a
   deployed run, for the same reason `salesforce-access.md` gives for
   `SF_CLIENT_SECRET`.

**Before you point this at a channel, decide who is in it.** The files carry
real people's names, titles and CRM state. A channel is easier to join than a
database is to query, and channel membership changes without anyone revisiting
this decision. §14's point about repository access being wider than the set of
people who should read a stakeholder map applies here in exactly the same
shape.

## Adding the dependency

`slack_sdk` isn't one of Quorom's own dependencies — it's something your
deployment needs for this delivery step specifically. How you declare it
depends on how your deployment installs Quorom in the first place: if you
already have a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for deployment-owned
code, add it there; if your only install step is `pip install -e .` against
this repo, add a small separate dependency file for your own scripts and
install it as an extra step, so it stays clearly distinguished from Quorom's
own pinned dependencies rather than merged into them.

**If you build your own image, the dependency file and the script are two
separate things to add to it.** Adding a `COPY` for `requirements.txt` does not
put `deliver_to_slack.py` in the image. It is easy to add one and forget the
other, and the failure is neither loud nor early: the build succeeds, the image
looks right, and the delivery step fails at run time with a plain "file not
found" — after the weekly run has already done all its work.

## Finding the files: read the manifest

`quorom weekly` writes `last_run.json` into `OUTPUT_DIR` as its final step —
the output paths and the week they belong to (§12). **Read that.** The
two alternatives both look reasonable and are both traps: rebuilding the
filename pattern yourself couples your script to names upstream can change, and
scraping the `[✓] Wrote …` log lines couples it to log output, which is not an
interface this project versions. Either would break at the *end* of a run,
after every Gong read and every CRM call had already been paid for, and it
would break quietly.

The manifest's presence also means the run finished, so a delivery step that
can't find it should fail rather than post a stale week.

## The script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Post a completed weekly run's output files to Slack.

Reads OUTPUT_DIR/last_run.json to find the run's files.

Env vars required:
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN   - bot token, xoxb-..., scopes: chat:write, files:write
    SLACK_CHANNEL_ID  - target channel ID (not the #name)
    OUTPUT_DIR        - the same directory quorom weekly writes to

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deliver(load_manifest(Path(os.environ.get("OUTPUT_DIR", "output"))))
```

Titles come from the filenames in the manifest rather than being composed in
the script — same reason as reading the manifest at all. Earlier drafts of this
file composed them by hand and got both names wrong.

The inputs `.json` isn't posted here — it's raw structured data, not something
a person reads in Slack, and it contains every input the run read. Add it as a
third upload if your team wants it, bearing in mind it is the most sensitive of
the files. The summary is posted as text instead: it holds counts only, no
names.

## Delivery is not retention

Posting to Slack does not satisfy §14's retention requirement. A channel is a
delivery surface with its own retention policy, usually set by someone else,
and a file posted to it is not a record you can reliably read back a year
later. Decide retention separately, as §14 describes.

## Three things that cost time before

- **A bot with no channel invite fails silently on the first post**, not at
  setup — the app and token both look fine until the first real message.
- **`files_upload_v2` rejects a channel name instantly, unclearly.** If the
  error mentions `channel_not_found` and you passed `#something`, that's the
  name-vs-ID mixup, not a permissions problem.
- **A delivery step that exits non-zero still needs somewhere to be seen.**
  If it runs as a separate step after `quorom weekly`, your runner now has two
  places a failure can happen. See `paas-deployment.md` on platform alerting
  covering service health rather than a run's exit code.
