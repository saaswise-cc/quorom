"""The CRM field map: resolved from the org, never hardcoded.

No network. The describe payload below is synthetic, but every awkward field in
it is a shape observed in a real Salesforce org during this work — a double
labelled '20% of Employees', a picklist headcount, a *Code twin holding 'US'
where its sibling holds 'United States', a LeanData status field whose label is
'State Info', and a LinkedIn field that is better populated than the one the
pipeline wants because it holds the *company's* page. A customer's actual field
list is not committed here: the repository holds patterns, never names.
