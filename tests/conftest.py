"""A real Postgres, the real migrations, and a fake Gong.

The CRM and provider legs a test cannot reach are left
unconfigured on purpose, so the run has to produce an artifact with stated gaps
rather than silently missing columns. That is the behaviour worth testing; the
CRM legs are verified against the live systems on the machine that can reach
them.

That absence is now enforced rather than assumed — see no_developer_credentials
below.

Set QUOROM_TEST_DSN to a Postgres a test may create databases on. Without it the
database tests skip rather than fail.
